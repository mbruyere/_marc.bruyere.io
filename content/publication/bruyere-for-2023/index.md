abstract: Even for experts, networks are complicated to troubleshoot, manage, and
  plan. Adopting human-centered design methods has the potential to facilitate the
  creation of more manageable networks. In this paper, we investigate a quantitative
  method that involves defining and measuring the complexity of operating different
  types of architectures from the perspective of the space of network parameters that
  need to be monitored and configured. We present OPLEX, a novel framework based on
  the analysis of YANG data models of network implementations that enables operators
  to compare architecture options based on the dimension of the parameter space. The
  benefits of the proposed framework are illustrated in the use case of Internet Exchange
  Point (IXP) network architectures, for which we take advantage of the rich set of
  publicly available data. We also exploit the survey results and direct consultations
  we conducted with operators and vendors of IXPs on their perception of complexity
  when operating different architectures. OPLEX is flexible, builds upon data models
  with widespread usage in the community, and provides a practical solution geared
  towards operators for characterizing the complexity of network architecture options.
